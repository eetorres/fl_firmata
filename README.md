==========

Firmata Test Program using the FLTK GUI. This is a Firmata test program. FLTK is a great GUI to develop PC interfaces for microcontrolers. The program was tested with the Arduino UNO and MEGA 2560. 

The FLTK GUI library can be downloaded from http://www.fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=1.3.3

This Git only has the code for the GUI app. In order to comunicate the PC with the Arduino. Using the ArduinoIDE the StandardFirmata from File->Examples->Firmata must be loaded in the Arduino board.
